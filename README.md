# odd-even Sorting algorithm 

In computing, an odd–even sort or odd–even transposition sort (also known as brick sort, is a relatively simple sorting algorithm, developed originally for use on *parallel processors* with local interconnections. It is a comparison sort related to bubble sort, with which it shares many characteristics. It functions by comparing all odd/even indexed pairs of adjacent elements in the list and, if a pair is in the wrong order (the first is larger than the second) the elements are switched. The next step repeats this for even/odd indexed pairs (of adjacent elements). Then it alternates between odd/even and even/odd steps until the list is sorted.
